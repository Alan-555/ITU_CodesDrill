# What is this project?
This is a very simple project, which one can use to practice one's knowledge in the ITU country codes.

I made this for my father, whom needed help to obtain his amateur radio license. He used to be a professional radio operator and now he returns to that in a form of a hobby.

I'm not sure why I made it public, but here we are.
